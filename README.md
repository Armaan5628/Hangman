#  Flutter Hangman (Guess the Word)

A simple **Guess the Word / Hangman** game built using **Flutter** with **state management** via `Provider`.

The game chooses a random word each round, lets the user guess letters, and tracks correct and wrong guesses.  
After 6 wrong guesses, the player loses — but can play again with a new random word.

##  Game Features
- ✅ Built with **Flutter** (cross-platform)
- ✅ Uses **Provider** for clean state management  
- ✅ Tracks wrong guesses (max 6)
- ✅ Reveals all matching letters when guessed (e.g., guessing `P` in `HAPPY` → `_ _ P P _`)
- ✅ Displays **WIN / LOSS** result
- ✅ “Play Again” button loads a new word
- ✅ Shows letters already guessed
- ✅ Each round uses a different random word
- ✅ Responsive layout for web and mobile

I took the help of chatgpt to publish github pages and to adjust the sizes of different buttons on my page as well as to fix some minor errors.
